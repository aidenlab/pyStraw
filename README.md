# Straw: rapidly stream data from .hic files
Straw is library which allows rapid streaming of contact data from .hic files. 
This repository contains source code for the C++, R, Python, and MATLAB versions of Straw.

For the Java version of Straw, see: https://github.com/aidenlab/java-straw/

For the Javascript version of Straw, see: https://github.com/igvteam/hic-straw/

There are two Python versions - a pure Python one and a version where the C++ code is bound with pybind11. The former version is deprecated in favor of using the pybind11 version, which is much faster.

A Jupyter notebook example can be found here: https://aidenlab.gitbook.io/juicebox/accessing-raw-data

## Quick Start Python

For the fastest version, you must have pybind11 installed.

Clone the library and `cd` into the `straw/` directory.
```
pip install ./pybind11_python
```
Then run your code via `import strawC` and `strawC.strawC`, for example:

```python
import strawC
result = strawC.strawC('observed', 'NONE', 'HIC001.hic', 'X', 'X', 'BP', 1000000)
for i in range(len(result)):
    print("{0}\t{1}\t{2}".format(result[i].binX, result[i].binY, result[i].counts))
```

## Compile on Linux

```bash
g++ -std=c++0x -o straw main.cpp straw.cpp -lcurl -lz
```
